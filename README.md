# Test-Automation-Robot
My intention with this project is to practice Robot Framework test automation/ scripting. It tests a fake Salesforce e-commerce website.

You can find tests that:
- Use Selenium Library;
- Map elements with CSS selector;
- Use arguments;
- Use page objects;
- Use conditionals;
- Use dictionaries;
- Assert information;
- Search products;
- Interact with product listing pages;
- Interact with product details page;
- Fill checkout shipping form;
- Fill checkout billing form;
- Place an invalid order with Credit Card;
- Place a valid order with Paypal;
- Navigate to different website pages and asserts that the product price is consistent.
